# Security Policy

## Vulnerability Response
Your report will be acknowledged within 2 business days.

Any information shared with the Aflorithmic security team stays within Aflorithmic and will not be disseminated except as 
required to get the issue fixed or to coordinate a vendor response.

As a security issue moves through our process we will keep the reporter updated.

Our goal is to disclose bugs as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. We will set a disclosure date once the bug is
well-understood (in consultation with the bug reporter and the relevant project maintainers).
