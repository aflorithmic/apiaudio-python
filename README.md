## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository is actively maintained by [Aflorithmic Labs](https://www.aflorithmic.ai/). For examples, recipes and api reference see the [api.audio docs](https://docs.api.audio/reference).

To publish a new version, please run `bash publish.sh`.

## Changelog
You can view [here](CHANGELOG.md) our updated Changelog. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify it. If you want to use the package, just run:

```sh
pip install apiaudio -U
```

Install from source with:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

### Prerequisites <a name = "requirements"></a>

Python 3.6+

## üöÄ Hello World <a name = "hello_world"></a>

Create a file `hello.py`

```python
touch hello.py
```

### Authentication

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is available in your [api.audio Console](https://console.api.audio). Import the apiaudio package and set `apiaudio.api_key` with the api-key you got from the console:

```python
import apiaudio
apiaudio.api_key = "your-key"
```

### Create Text to audio in 4 steps

Let's create our first audio from text.

‚úçÔ∏è Create a new script:

```python
script = apiaudio.Script.create(scriptText="Hello world", scriptName="hello")
print(script)
```

üé§ Create a speech audio file from the script using Aria's voice:

```python
response = apiaudio.Speech.create(scriptId=script["scriptId"], voice="Aria")
print(response)
```

üéß Now let's master the speech file with high quality and a nice soundtemplate.

```python
response = apiaudio.Mastering.create(
	scriptId=script.get("scriptId"),
	soundTemplate="jakarta"
	)
print(response)
```

Download the files in your current folder:

```python
filepath = apiaudio.Mastering.download(scriptId=script["scriptId"], destination=".")
print(filepath)
```

Easy right? üîÆ This is the `hello.py` final picture:

```python
import apiaudio
apiaudio.api_key = "your-key"

# script creation
script = apiaudio.Script.create(scriptText="Hello world", scriptName="hello")

# speech creation
response = apiaudio.Speech.create(scriptId=script["scriptId"], voice="Joanna")
print(response)

# mastering process
response = apiaudio.Mastering.create(
	scriptId=script.get("scriptId"),
	soundTemplate="parisianmorning"
	)
print(response)

# or download
filepath = apiaudio.Mastering.download(scriptId=script["scriptId"], destination=".")
print(filepath)
```

Now let's run the code:

```sh
python hello.py
```

Once completed, check the files in the `hello.py` root folder - you will see a new audio file. Play it!

## üìë Documentation <a name = "documentation"></a>

### Import <a name = "import"></a>

```python
import apiaudio
```

### Authentication <a name = "authentication"></a>

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is available in your [Aflorithmic Dashboard](https://console.api.audio). Set `apiaudio.api_key` with the api-key you got from the dashboard:

```python
apiaudio.api_key = "your-key"
```

### Authentication with environment variable (recommended) <a name = "authentication_env"></a>

You can also authenticate using `apiaudio_key` environment variable and the apiaudio SDK will automatically use it. To setup, open the terminal and type:

```sh
export apiaudio_key=<your-key>
```

If you provide both environment variable and `apiaudio.api_key` authentication, the `apiaudio.api_key` will be used.

### Resource Usage <a name = "resource"> </a>

There are two approaches to use the resources.
First approach is to import the resource classes you want to use first, then use resource methods. For example, to use `Script`, we could do:

```python
from apiaudio import Script
Script.create()
```

The second approach is to use it directly from apiaudio:

```python
import apiaudio
apiaudio.Script.create()
```

Same logic applies for other resources (`Speech`, `Voice`, `Sound`...)

### `Script` resource <a name = "script"> </a>

The Script resource/class allows you to create, retrieve and list scripts. Learn more about scripts [here](https://docs.api.audio/docs/script-2).

Script methods are:

- `create()` - Create a new script.
  - Parameters:
    - `scriptText` \* [Required] (string) - Text for your script. A script can contain multiple sections and SSML tags. Learn more about scriptText details [here](https://docs.api.audio/docs/script-2)

    ```
    - Categories currently available: `"BibleVerse"`, `"FunFact"`, `"InspirationalQuote"`, `"Joke"`, `"MovieSynopsis"`, `"Poem"`, `"PhilosophicalQuestion"`, `"Recipe"`, `"TriviaQuestion"`.

### `Speech` resource <a name = "speech"> </a>

Speech allows you to do Text-To-Speech (TTS) with our API using all the voices available. Use it to create a speech audio file from your script.

Speech methods are:

- `create()` Send a Text-To-Speech request to our Text-To-Speech service.
  - Parameters:
    - `scriptId` \* [Required] (string) - The script ID
    - `version` (string) - The version of the script to be produced. Default is "".
    - `voice` (string) - Voice name. See the list of available voices using [Voice resource](#voice). Default voice is "Joanna".
    - `speed` (string) - Voice speed. Default speed is 100.
    - `effect` (string) - Put a funny effect in your voice. You can try the following ones: `dark_father`, `chewie`, `88b`, `2r2d`, `volume_boost_low` `volume_boost_middle` `volume_boost_high` (Volume boost allows you to adjust the volume of speech. NOTE! Volume boost effect only applies to speech creation and will be overwritten by the mastering process)
    - `silencePadding` (integer) - Add a silence padding to your speech tracks (in milliseconds). Default is 0 (no padding)
    - `audience` (dict) - Specify the values of parameters in your script. For instance, if in the script resource you have `scriptText="Hello {{name}} {{lastname}}, welcome to {{location}}"`, the audience should be: `{"name": "Elon", "lastname": "Musk", "location": "Istanbul"}`. If not provided, the fallback track will be created.
    - `sync` (boolean) - Allow sync or async speech creation. Default is `True`. If `sync=False`, speech create call will return a success message when the speech creation is triggered. To retrieve the files, check `Speech.retrieve()` method.
    - `sections` (dict) - Specify parameters for specific sections in the script. The key is a section name, and the value is another dictionary with the section configuration ( valid parameters are: voice, speed, effect, silence_padding). If a section is not found here, the section will automatically inherit the voice, speed, effect and silence_padding values you defined above (or the default ones if you don't provide them). See an example below with 2 sections and different configuration parameters being used.
      ```python
      sections={
          "firstsection": {
              "voice": "Matthew",
              "speed": 110,
              "silence_padding": 100
          },
          "anothersection": {
              "voice": "en-GB-RyanNeural",
              "speed": 100
          }
      }
      ```
  - Simple example:

    ```

### `Birdcache` resource <a name = "birdcache"> </a>

Birdcache is a caching service provided by API.audio that provides the caching layer for the customer by storing data in API.audio servers for future use. This allows you to retrieve your speech files on the fly.

Birdcache methods are:

- `create()` Create a TTS speech file.

  - Parameters:

    - `type` \* [Required] (string) - Type of the event. Supported types are `mastering` and `speech`.
    - `text` \* [Required] (string) - The text you want to do speech/mastering with. See the example for personalisation parameters.
    - `voice` \* [Required] (string) - The voice for speech creation.
    - `audience` \* [Optional] (dict) - The key pair object for personalisation parameters. See the example below.
    - `soundTemplate` [Optional] (string) - The sound template for mastering creation. Only needed when the type is mastering.

  - Example:

    birdcache = apiaudio.Birdcache.create(
      type="mastering",
      voice="linda",
      text="This is {{username|me}} creating synchronous text to speech",
      audience={"username": ["salih", "sam", "timo"]},
      soundTemplate="electronic"
    )
    ```

### `Lexi` resource <a name = "lexi"> </a>

Lexi is an engine for enhancing the pronunciation of troublesome words. For example, ensuring the city name `reading` is pronounced correctly. Dictionaries are split into languages and types. For example, the city `reading` would be of type `location` with language `en-gb` and in this case in the `UkCities` dictionary.

To use this feature words in the script should be marked up with the `<!'type'>` flag, whereby type is the type of dictionary to use. The dictionary flag that precedes the word should contain the type, and the one following should be empty `<!>`. In the example shown below, the second occurrence of the word **reading** will be pronounced as the city name.

Example:

    ```python
    scriptText = "Hello I am reading a book in the city of <!location>reading<!> today"
    ```

Lexi methods are:

- `list()` List the available dictionaries

  - Parameters:

    - `lang` [Optional] (string) - Filter by language code, e.g. `en-gb` or `es`.
    - `type` [Optional] (string) - Filter by type e.g. `location`.

  - Example:

    ```python
    # returns all english gb dictionaries of type name
    dictionaries = apiaudio.Lexi.list(lang="en-gb", type="name")

    ```

- `list_types()` List the available types

  - Parameters:
    - `none`
  - Example:

    ```python
    # returns the valid flag types, i.e location, name, brand
    types = apiaudio.Lexi.list_types()

    ```

- `list_words()` Lists all the words contained in a dictionary.

  - Parameters:

  - `dictId` \* [Required] (string) - The id of the dictionary.
  - Example:
    ```python
    # lists all words in the dictionary
    words = apiaudio.Lexi.list_words(dictId="uk_cities")
    ```

- `search_for_word()` Searches to see if a word is in any of the dictionaries.

  - Parameters:

    - `word` \* [Required] (string) - Word to look for.
    - `language` \* [Required] (string) - language code to use e.g. `en-gb`.

  - Example:

    ```python
    # Checks if the word bristol exists
    result = apiaudio.Lexi.search_for_word(word="bristol", lang="en-gb")

    ```

#### Preview

The effect of applying Lexi can be seen with the `script.preview()` method. See [Script](#script) documentation for more details.

- Example:

  ```python
    text = """
      The author of this repo has lived in two places in the
      UK, <!location>Bude<!> and <!location>Bristol<!>.
    """

  r = apiaudio.Script.create(scriptText=text)
  scriptId = r["scriptId"]

  # preview the script in en-gb
  preview = apiaudio.Script.preview(scriptId=scriptId, language="en-gb")
  print(preview)
  ```

- Response:
  ```python
  "The author of this repo has lived in two places in the UK, bude and [<!>bristol<!>]".
  ```
  In this example Bristol is in a location dictionary, but Bude is not. Lexi will ensure words marked between `[<!>....<!>]` will be pronounced correctly.

### Logging <a name = "logging"></a>

By default, warnings issued by the API are logged in the console output. Additionally, some behaviors are logged on the informational level (e.g. "In progress..." indicators during longer processing times).
The level of logging can be controlled by choosing from the standard levels in Python's `logging` library.

- Decreasing logging level for more detailed logs:
  ```python
  apiaudio.set_logger_level("INFO")
  # apiaudio.set_logger_level("CRITICAL") - set the highest level to disable logs
  ```

# Development

There is a pre-commit hook that will run before you commit a file. This is to keep the code standards high. To enable it, you should run `make`. Then it will set up the pre-commit hook for git. Thats all! Now every time before you commit, it will run to tell you about the standards.

If you use VSCode for committing files, you may bump into `pre-commit command not found` error. That is ok, just run `brew install pre-commit` or your fave package manager [from the list here](https://pre-commit.com/#installation).

If you bump into `your pip version is old` error, just ignore it and use the terminal.

If there is a problem and you are in a rush, you can add `--no-verify` at the end of the commit command, it will skip the pre-commit hooks, e.g `git commit -m 'your commit message' --no-verify`
