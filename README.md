## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository is actively maintained by [Aflorithmic Labs](https://www.aflorithmic.ai/). For examples, recipes and api reference see the [api.audio docs](https://docs.api.audio/reference). Feel free to get in touch with any questions or feedback!

## :book:  Changelog

You can view [here](CHANGELOG.md) our updated Changelog.

## :speedboat:  Quickstarts <a name = "quickstarts"></a>

Get started with our [quickstart recipes](https://github.com/aflorithmic/examples).

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify it. If you want to use the package, just run:

```sh
pip install apiaudio -U
#or
pip3 install apiaudio -U
```

Install from source with:

```sh
python setup.py install
#or
python3 setup.py install
```

### Prerequisites <a name = "requirements"></a>

Python 3.6+

## üöÄ Hello World <a name = "hello_world"></a>

Create a file `hello.py`

```python
touch hello.py
```

### Authentication

This library needs to be configured with your account's api-key which is available in your [api.audio Console](https://console.api.audio). Import the apiaudio package and set `apiaudio.api_key` with the api-key you got from the console:

```python
import apiaudio
apiaudio.api_key = "your-key"
```


### Create Text to audio in 4 steps

Let's create our first audio asset.

‚úçÔ∏è Create a new script, our `scriptText` will be the text that is later synthesized.

```python
script = apiaudio.Script.create(scriptText="Hello world")
print(script)
```

üé§ Render the scriptText that was created in the previous step. Lets use voice Aria.

```python
response = apiaudio.Speech.create(scriptId=script["scriptId"], voice="Aria")
print(response)
```

üéß Now let's join the speech we just created with a sound template.

```python
response = apiaudio.Mastering.create(
	scriptId=script.get("scriptId"),
	soundTemplate="jakarta"
	)
print(response)
```

Download the final audio asset to your current working directory:

```python
filepath = apiaudio.Mastering.download(scriptId=script["scriptId"], destination=".")
print(filepath)
```

Easy right? üîÆ This is the final `hello.py` file.

```python
import apiaudio
apiaudio.api_key = "your-key"

# script creation
script = apiaudio.Script.create(scriptText="Hello world")

# speech creation
response = apiaudio.Speech.create(scriptId=script["scriptId"], voice="Aria")

print(response)

# mastering process
response = apiaudio.Mastering.create(
	scriptId=script.get("scriptId"),
	soundTemplate="jakarta"
	)
print(response)

# download
filepath = apiaudio.Mastering.download(scriptId=script["scriptId"], destination=".")
print(filepath)
```

Now let's run the code:

```sh
python hello.py
#or
python3 hello.py
```

Once this has completed, find the downloaded audio asset and play it! :sound: :sound: :sound: 

## üìë Documentation <a name = "documentation"></a>

### Import <a name = "import"></a>

```python
import apiaudio
```

### Authentication <a name = "authentication"></a>

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is available in your [Aflorithmic Dashboard](https://console.api.audio). Set `apiaudio.api_key` with the api-key you got from the dashboard:

```python
apiaudio.api_key = "your-key"
```

### Authentication with environment variable (recommended) <a name = "authentication_env"></a>

You can also authenticate using `apiaudio_key` environment variable and the apiaudio SDK will automatically use it. To setup, open the terminal and type:

```sh
export apiaudio_key=<your-key>
```

If you provide both an environment variable and `apiaudio.api_key` authentication value, the `apiaudio.api_key` value will be used instead.

### Super Organizations

In order to control a child organization of yours, please use the following method to *assume* that organization id.

Set your child organization id to `None` to stop assuming an organization. Subsequent calls to the api will use your own organization id.

```python
import apiaudio

apiaudio.set_assume_org_id('child_org_id')

# Stop using
apiaudio.set_assume_org_id(None)
```

See [organization](#organization) resource for more operations you can perform about your organization.

### Resource Usage <a name = "resource"> </a>

There are two approaches to use the resources.

The recommended approach is to import all resources directly from apiaudio:

```python
import apiaudio
apiaudio.Script.create()
```


Alternatively, you can import the resource classes you want to use first, and then use the resource methods. For example, to use `Script`, we could do:

```python
from apiaudio import Script
Script.create()
```


Same logic applies for other resources (`Speech`, `Voice`, `Sound`...)

### `Organization` resource <a name = "organization"> </a>

  - Parameters:
    - None.
  - Example:
    ```python
    child_orgs = apiaudio.Organization.list_child_orgs()

### `Speech` resource <a name = "speech"> </a>

Speech allows you to do Text-To-Speech (TTS) with our API using all the voices available. Use it to create a speech audio file from your script.

Speech methods are:

- `create()` Send a Text-To-Speech request to our Text-To-Speech service.

  - Parameters:

    - `scriptId` \* [Required] (string) - The script ID
    - `version` (string) - The version of the script to be produced. Default is "".
    - `voice` (string) - Voice name. See the list of available voices using [Voice resource](#voice). Default voice is "Joanna".
    - `speed` (string) - Voice speed. Default speed is 100.
    - `effect` (string) - Put a funny effect in your voice. You can try the following ones: `dark_father`, `chewie`, `88b`, `2r2d`,
    - `silencePadding` (integer) - Add a silence padding to your speech tracks (in milliseconds). Default is 0 (no padding)
    - `audience` (dict) - Specify the values of parameters in your script. For instance, if in the script resource you have `scriptText="Hello {{name}} {{lastname}}, welcome to {{location}}"`, the audience should be: `{"name": "Elon", "lastname": "Musk", "location": "Istanbul"}`. If not provided, the fallback track will be created.
    - `sync` (boolean) - Allow sync or async speech creation. Default is `True`. If `sync=False`, speech create call will return a success message when the speech creation is triggered. To retrieve the files, check `Speech.retrieve()` method.
    - `sections` (dict) - Specify parameters for specific sections in the script. The key is a section name, and the value is another dictionary with the section configuration ( valid parameters are: voice, speed, effect, silence_padding). If a section is not found here, the section will automatically inherit the voice, speed, effect and silence_padding values you defined above (or the default ones if you don't provide them). See an example below with 2 sections and different configuration parameters being used.
    - `useDictionary` (bool) - Applies pronunciation dictionary to the script text.
    - `useTextNormalizer` (bool) - Applies text normalization, which can help resolve grammatical errors with TTS pronunciations, for example 11:12 Uhr -> 11 Uhr 12. Note - this only works for german voices at present.
      ```python
      sections={
          "firstsection": {
              "voice": "Matthew",
              "speed": 110,
              "silence_padding": 100
          },
          "anothersection": {
              "voice": "en-GB-RyanNeural",
              "speed": 100
          }
      }
      ```

  - Simple example:
    ```python
    response = apiaudio.Speech.create(
        scriptId="id-1234",

        speed=100,
        effect="dark_father",
        silencePadding= 1000,
        sync=True,
        audience={"username": "Elon", "lastname": "Musk"},
        sections={
            "firstsection": {
                "voice": "Matthew",
                "speed": 110,

A mastered version contains the speech of the script, a background track, personalised parameters for your audience and a mastering process to enhance the audio quality of the whole track. In order to get a mastered audio file, make sure you requested [speech](#speech) for your script resource first.

Mastering methods are:

- `create()` Create a mastered version of your script and choose the audio format.

  - Parameters:

    - `forceLength` (int) - force the audio length of the mastered track (in seconds).
    - `audience` (dict) - Dictionary containing the personalisation parameters. This parameter depends on the number of parameters you used in your [script](#script) resource. In the script documentation example above, we used 2 parameters: `username` and `location`, and in the following example below we want to produce the script for username `salih` with location `Barcelona`. If audience is not provided, the fallback track will be created.
    - `mediaFiles` (list) - List of dicts containing the media files. This parameter depends on the media file tags used in the [script](#script) resource and the media files you have in your account. For example, if the script contains `<<media::myrecording>>` plus `<<media::mysong>>`, and you want to attach myrecording to mediaId = "12345", and mysong to mediaId = "67890" then `mediaFiles = [{"myrecording":"12345", "mysong":"67890"}]`.
    - `mediaVolumeTrim` (float) - Floating point varible that allows you to trim the volume of uploaded media files (in dB). This attribute has a valid range of -12 to 12 dB and applies to all media files included in a single mastering call. Clipping protection is not provided so only make incremental adjustments.

### `SyncTTS` resource <a name = "synctts"> </a>

SyncTTS allows you to do Synchronous Text-To-Speech (TTS) with our API using all the voices available. Use it to create a speech audio file from a text and a voice name. The response contains wave bytes ready to be played or written to a file.

SyncTTS methods are:

- `create()` Create a TTS speech file.

  - Parameters:

    - `voice` \* [Required] (string) - The voice name. See the list of available voices using [Voice resource](#voice).
    - `text` \* [Required] (string) - The text you want to do TTS with. The limit is 800 characters for wave files.

    )
    ```

### `Birdcache` resource <a name = "birdcache"> </a>

Birdcache is a caching service provided by API.audio that provides the caching layer for the customer by storing data in API.audio servers for future use. This allows you to retrieve your speech files on the fly.

Birdcache methods are:

- `create()` Create a TTS speech file.

  - Parameters:

    - `type` \* [Required] (string) - Type of the event. Supported types are `mastering` and `speech`.
    - `text` \* [Required] (string) - The text you want to do speech/mastering with. See the example for personalisation parameters.

    birdcache = apiaudio.Birdcache.create(
      type="mastering",
      voice="linda",
      text="This is {{username|me}} creating synchronous text to speech",
      audience={"username": ["salih", "sam", "timo"]},
      soundTemplate="electronic"
    )
    ```

### `Pronunciation Dictionary` resource <a name = "pronunciationdictionary"> </a>

Often when working with TTS, the models can fail to accurately pronounce specific words, for example brands, names and locations are commonly mis-pronounced. As a first attempt to fix this we have introduced our lexi flag, which works in a similar way to SSML. For example, adding <!peadar> instead of Peadar (who is one of our founders) to your script will cause the model to produce an alternative pronunciation of this name. This is particularly useful in cases where words can have multiple pronunciations, for example the cities ‚Äòreading‚Äô and ‚Äònice‚Äô. In this instance placing <!reading> and <!nice> will ensure that these are pronounced correctly, given the script:

`" The city of <!nice> is a really nice place in the south of france."`

If this solution does not work for you, you can instead make use of our custom (self-serve) lexi feature.

This can be used to achieve one of two things, correcting single words, or expanding acronyms. For example, you can replace all occurrences of the word Aflorithmic with ‚Äúaf low rhythmic‚Äù or occurrences of the word ‚ÄòBMW‚Äô with ‚ÄúBayerische Motoren Werke‚Äù. Replacement words can be supplied as plain text or an IPA phonemisation.

Prononciation dictionary methods are:

- `list()` Lists the publicly available dictionaries and their words

  - Parameters:

    - `none`

  - Example:

    ```python
    # returns a list of public dictionaries
    dictionaries = apiaudio.Lexi.list()

    ```

- `list_custom_dicts()` Lists the custom dictionaries and their respective words

  - Parameters:
    - `none`
  - Example:

    ```python
    # returns a list of custom dictionaries
    types = apiaudio.Lexi.list_custom_dicts()

    ```

- `register_custom_word` Adds a new word to a custom dictionary.

  - `lang` [required] (string) - Language family, e.g. `en` or `es`.dictionary - use `global` to register a word globally.
  - `word` [required] (string) - The word that will be replaced
  - `replacement` [required] (string) - The replacement token. Can be either a plain string or a IPA token.
  - `contentType` [optional] (string) - The content type of the supplied replacement, can be either `basic` (default) or `ipa` for phonetic replacements.
  - `specialization` [optional] (string) - by default the supplied replacement will apply regardless of the supplied voice, language code or provider. However edge cases can be supplied, these can be either a valid; provider name, language code (i.e. en-gb) or voice name.
  -
  - Example:
    ```python
      # correct the word sapiens
      r = apiaudio.Lexi.register_custom_word(word="sapiens", replacement="saypeeoons", lang="en")
      print(r)
    ```

  For each language, only a single word entry is permitted. However, each word can have multiple `specializations`. When a word is first registered a `default` `specialization` is always created, which will match what is passed in. Subsequent calls with different specializations will only update the given specialization. The exact repacement that will be used is determined by the following order of preference:

  ` voice name > language dialect > provider name > default`

  For example, a replacement specified for voice name `sara` will be picked over a replacement specified for provider `azure`.

- `list_custom_words()` Lists all the words contained in a custom dictionary.

  - Parameters:

  - `lang` [required] (string) - Language family, e.g. `en` or `es` - use `global` to list language agnostic words.
  - Example:
    ```python
    # lists all words in the dictionary along with their replacements
    words = apiaudio.Lexi.list_custom_words(lang="en")
    ```

#### Preview

The effect of applying the Pronunciation Dictionary can be seen with the `script.preview()` method. See [Script](#script) documentation for more details.

- Example:

  ```python
    text = """
      The author of this repo has lived in two places in the
      UK, <!Bude> and <!Bristol>
    """

  r = apiaudio.Script.create(scriptText=text)
  scriptId = r["scriptId"]

  # preview the script in en-gb
  preview = apiaudio.Script.preview(scriptId=scriptId, voice="Joanna")
  print(preview)
  ```

- Response:
  ```python
  {"preview" : "The author of this repo has lived in two places in the UK, bude and <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"###\"> bristol </phoneme>"}
  ```
  In this example `Bristol` will be phonemised to ensure it is correctly pronouced, but as `Bude` is not in our a dictionaires it is left as is. The exact IPA tokens for words in our internal dictionaires are obsfucated.

### `Orchestrator` resource <a name = "Orchestrator"> </a>

The orchestrator is used to make working with a range of audio services as easy as sending a single API request. Each route here is carefully configured to produce high-quality and easy to access audio assets.

Orchestrator methods are:

- `create_audio()` Creates a simple TTS speech request and adds a sound template to it through mastering.

  - Parameters:

    - `scriptText` \* [Required] (str) - Text to synthesize (TTS).
    - `soundTemplate` (str) - Sound template to use.

### Webhooks

This SDK provides an easy way of verifying apiaudio webhook call security headers. It is highly recommended for you to verify the headers in order to protect your server from any malicious attack.

The method is:

```python
apiaudio.Webhooks.verify(payload, sig_header, secret, tolerance)
```

It will return true if the header is valid, otherwise it will raise an error.
The parameters to pass are; `payload` being the body object sent by apiaudio, `sig_header` being `X-Aflr-Secret` in the request headers sent by apiaudio, `secret` being your webhook secret (you can get it in apiaudio console) and `tolerance` being the tolerance in seconds for the header checks, which defaults to 300 seconds.

### Logging <a name = "logging"></a>

By default, warnings issued by the API are logged in the console output. Additionally, some behaviors are logged on the informational level (e.g. "In progress..." indicators during longer processing times).
The level of logging can be controlled by choosing from the standard levels in Python's `logging` library.

- Decreasing logging level for more detailed logs:
  ```python
  apiaudio.set_logger_level("INFO")
  # apiaudio.set_logger_level("CRITICAL") - set the highest level to disable logs
  ```

# Maintainers <a name = "maintainers"> </a>

# Development

There is a pre-commit hook that will run before you commit a file. This is to keep the code standards high. To enable it, you should run `make`. Then it will set up the pre-commit hook for git. Thats all! Now every time before you commit, it will run to tell you about the standards.

If you use VSCode for committing files, you may bump into `pre-commit command not found` error. That is ok, just run `brew install pre-commit` or your fave package manager [from the list here](https://pre-commit.com/#installation).

If you bump into `your pip version is old` error, just ignore it and use the terminal.

If there is a problem and you are in a rush, you can add `--no-verify` at the end of the commit command, it will skip the pre-commit hooks, e.g `git commit -m 'your commit message' --no-verify`
